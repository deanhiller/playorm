play plugin for NoSql stuff to make that easier
need @Embedded tag as well

allow query by row key if they just do where table.rowkey = :id  but for >,<, they have to Index it

Add the in clause in S-SQL so we can also do a findAll without findAll method at all

tests for extra data so we can read in row AND read in data we don't have schema for as well to tack on to entity

Add generic Map<ByteArray, byte[]> to suck in additional columns we don't have schema for as well

playframework plugin as well using query interface in development mode

don't allow someone to create entity and just save as entity could exist.  This causes index corruption too easy and users
are very likely to accidentally do this.

delayed joins not working yet

test query by a data format like 10/2/21 10:15:37.893

allow to query on non-index fields!!!
